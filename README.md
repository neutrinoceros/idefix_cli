# `idefix_cli`

`idefix_cli` is a command line utility belt for [Idefix](https://github.com/idefix-code/idefix).

It defines a `idfx` command familly. The builtin command set (`idfx conf`, `idfx run`,
...) can be extended to include arbitrary helper scripts.


## Installation

`idefix_cli` is distributed via the Python Packaging Index (PyPI).

It is recommended to install this tool at the system level, but still in isolation,
using for instance [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as
```shell
$ uv tool install idefix-cli
```
or [`pipx`](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/)
```shell
$ pipx install idefix-cli
```

Otherwise, the most portable way to install the latest stable version is
```shell
$ python -m pip install --user idefix_cli
```

Note that most `idfx` commands explicitly require that the env variable `$IDEFIX_DIR` be
set at runtime.

## Get help

Get a complete description of available commands with
```shell
$ idfx --help
```
Likewise, get help for each command therein as, for instance
```shell
$ idfx run --help
```
