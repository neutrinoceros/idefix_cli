# `idefix_cli`

`idefix_cli` is command line framework to facilitate working with
[Idefix](https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/lesurg/idefix-public),
written by Geoffroy Lesur et al.

It defines a `idfx` command namespace, ships with a collection of common helper
script (`idfx conf`, `idfx run`, ...), and can be extended to include arbitrary
helper scripts.


## Installation

`idefix_cli` is distributed via the Python Packaging Index (PyPI).

It is recommended to install this tool in isolation with [`pipx`](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) as
```shell
$ pipx install "idefix_cli[isolated]"
```
(adding `[isolated]` has the effect of pinning dependencies)

Otherwise, the most portable way to install the latest stable version is
```shell
$ python -m pip install --user idefix_cli
```

Note that most `idfx` commands explicitly require that the env variable `$IDEFIX_DIR` be
set at runtime.

## Get help

Get a complete description of available commands with
```shell
$ idfx --help
```
Likewise, get help for each command therein as, for instance
```shell
$ idfx run --help
```
